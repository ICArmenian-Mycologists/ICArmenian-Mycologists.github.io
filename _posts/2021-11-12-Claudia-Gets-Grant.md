#Congratulations to Claudia for obtaining the BGCI ArbNet grant!

Claudia wrote a successful grant to BGCI ArbNet and won $3,000 to sequence the oak roots we collected in Armenia. 
The DNA will be extracted at Yerevan Botanical Gargen (YBG) but the sequencing will occur in Holden University.

Congratulations Claudia!
