November 14, 2020.
As soon as the war ended between Azerbaijan and Armenia Claudia, Patty and Tania were discussing how to help their war torned country. Tania knew Arik from her Microbiology program and thus started the ICAM journey. Our first meeting was November 14th, we met through zoom and discussed our thoughts, frustrations and ideas about what an organizational effort would look like.

We met up every week after that to discuss and plan different points we want to address.
