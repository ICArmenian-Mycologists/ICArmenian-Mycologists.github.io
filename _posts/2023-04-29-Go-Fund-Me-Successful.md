🍄- Our collaborators at the A. Takhtajyan Institute of Botany in Yerevan, Armenia has just opened the molecular biology lab!
This lab was fully renovated largely thanks to the support from generous donors from our GoFundMe![https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-provide-icamarmenia-with-a-molecular-lab]
We are so excited to have this space operational so that cutting-edge mycological research can continue to advance in Armenia 🇦🇲

We want to give a massive, heartfelt THANK YOU to all of our GoFundMe donors, and to all who have been sharing and supporting our efforts over the past 3 years.
