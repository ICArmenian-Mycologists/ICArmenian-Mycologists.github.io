We just got word that we received funging from the Socety for the Protection of Underground Networks (SPUN)! 
SPUN seeks to advance mycological research of soil fungi and work towards the conservation of these dynamic, integral, and poorly understood realms of life.

SPUN has been funding research around the world, and ours will be the first such project in Armenia 🇦🇲
This project will also add substantially to the mycorrhizal knowledge in West Asia more broadly! 🍄🍄🍄

Our primary goal is to compare fungal diversity and community composition between variad microclimates within the mountains of the Armenian highlands.
To determine how these climatic differences impact soil fungi, we will use high throughput sequencing to compare the fungal species composition.

So, we will soon have the opportunity to utilize the new mycology molecular lab we helped provide for.


OUR VISION - Is to sustainably build and maintain long term partnerships with our colleages in Armenia. This work is slow, but we are starting to see some tangible outcomes.

🇦🇲🍄 Thank you for being here for the journey! 🇦🇲🍄
