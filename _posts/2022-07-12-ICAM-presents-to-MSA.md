Showcasing our work at the Mycological Society of America conference in Gainesville, FL! So glad we got to talk about our work to MSA and to bring awareness to the mycological work occurring abroad!
We had many inquiries about our work, what the topology of Armenia looked like, and what scientific advancements Armenia would be capable of in regard to mycology.

Lots of questions, and lots to think about.
