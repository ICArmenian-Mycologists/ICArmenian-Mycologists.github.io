We had many inquiries about our work, what the topology of Armenia looked like, and what scientific advancements Armenia would be capable of in regard to mycology.</p>

<p>Lots of questions, and lots to think about.

<p>To Armenia.. In pursuit of knowledge, lichens, and mushrooms</p>

<p>When you think of the country Armenia, what comes to mind? Maybe you know of a few famous Armenians, such as Cher, System of a Down, or the Kardashians. 
President Biden recently became the first U.S. president to acknowledge the Armenian genocide, which occurred under the Ottoman Turk regime from 1915-1918 killing 1.5 million Armenians from their homeland (1,2,3). 
Between 800,000 to 1.2 million Armenians were deported from Turkey…</p>

<p>On February 7th, 2021 ICAM made contact with Armenia. Specifically an individual, Dr. Arsen Gasparyan, who is a classically trained/educated lichenologist.
He completed his Ph.D. in Berlin Germany on Lichen Diversity in Armenia.</p>

<p>ICAM was very excited to meet and discuss our common goals and plans.</p>

<p>November 14, 2020.
As soon as the war ended between Azerbaijan and Armenia Claudia, Patty and Tania were discussing how to help their war torned country. Tania knew Arik from her Microbiology program and thus started the ICAM journey. Our first meeting was November 14th, we met through zoom and discussed our thoughts, frustrations and ideas about what an organizational effort would look like.</p>

<p>We met up every week after that to discuss and plan different points we want to add…</p>

  <p data-search="To Armenia   In pursuit of knowledge  lichens  and mushroomsWhen you think of the country Armenia  what comes to mind  Maybe you know of a few famous Armenians  such as Cher  System of a Down  or the Kardashians  President Biden recently became the first U S  president to acknowledge the Armenian genocide  which occurred under the Ottoman Turk regime from 1915 1918 killing 1 5 million Armenians from their homeland  1 2 3   Between 800 000 to 1 2 million Armenians were deported from Turkey to the Syrian Desert  basically reducing the population of Armenians in the region by 90   4 5   What you might not know is that Armenia is an ancient and yet contemporary civilization situated within a biodiversity hotspot  the Caucasus Mountain range in Southwest Asia  6   The region is home to more than 6000 species of plants  153 species of mammals and 400 species of birds  some of which are endemic to Armenia 7 8   Armenia is home to large stretches of undisturbed primary forests  of which the Armenian people have a long history of land stewardship and of intimate connection with the unique and beautiful landscape In July we travelled to Armenia for a week long field excursion with a small group of local Armenian biologists  Together we form the International Congress of Armenian Mycologists  ICAM   We consist of ethnically Armenian scientists on different breaths of the scientific academic journey                     The founders of the International Congress of Armenian Mycologists in Artavan  From the left  Arik Joukhajian  Claudia Victoroff Bashian  Dr Patricia Kaishian  and Tania Kurbessoian      Dr  Patricia Kashian now faculty at Bard College in New York  Tania Kurbessoian a fifth year Microbiology PhD candidate at UC Riverside  Claudia Victoroff Bashian a second year Biology PhD student at Case Holden University and Arik Joukhadjian a second year Microbiology PhD Student at UC Riverside We are a network of research scientists of Armenian ethnicity allied in the mission of biological  ecological  and social welfare for all Armenian life  Because fungi are understudied worldwide  and Armenia has been home to a relatively low proportion of that research  we aim to describe new species and accrue data for answering critical ecological and evolutionary questions  In July we conducted scientific research on fungal diversity and forest ecology on our ancestral homeland  We collected and identified lichens  mushrooms  and rust fungi to record fungal biodiversity in the region  We collected soil samples from across the country to analyze the soil organisms  fungi and bacteria  in different ecoregions of Armenia We began our trip in Yerevan  Armenia s 12th capital city in its long history  It was first founded in 782 B C E  by Urartu king Argishti the first  who named it Erebuni  The city was rebuilt after the first World War and the Armenian Genocide when its people came back to live in Armenia once it was under Russian regime  Yerevan is called  The Pink City  due to most of its buildings made with tuff  a pink volcanic rock endemic to this region  Yerevan city is a hub for art  music  dancing  and culture After meeting with our collaborators in Armenia via zoom for the last 10 months  it was a relief to sit down and share a meal together in real life  Our itinerary was developed by our friend and colleague Dr  Arsen Gasparyan  who is not only a brilliant scientist  but a fierce advocate for wildlife conservation and sustainable development in Armenia He has led many efforts through WWF or the World Wildlife Fund for Nature  an international non governmental organization committed to preserving wildlife  He received his PhD at the Freie Universitat Berlin in lichenology  where he focused his entire dissertation on identifying new and well known lichens in Armenia 9 10 11 12   He is now back in Armenia  working through the ARTrails to bring youth and foreign interest to the ancient forests of Armenia Early in the morning we gathered in our transport van and travelled from Yerevan  stopping near the town of Hankavan where we collected our first samples  Not only did we scour the ground and trees for lichens and fungi but we also collected soil samples using spades and bulb planters                     Razmig Sargsyan and Arik collect soil cores for high throughput sequencing                          Patty and Claudia pose with the first of many sticks for the herbarium      While the dry soil in Hankavan meant that few mushrooms were growing  our group had fun getting to know each other while hiking through the woods  We rested at a natural hot spring and had a lunch of fresh veggies  Armenian flatbread called lavash  and  of course  a variety of kebabs                     The fog setting in a Dilijan forest      From Hankavan we traveled north to the town of Dilijan and to Dilijan National Park  While the southern half of Armenia is relatively arid  the northern half is found in much higher altitudes and is extremely lush  In Dilijan we hiked the Hidden Waterfall trail  13  and the Drunken Forest Trail  14   both described by the HikeArmenia app                     An AR experience through the hiking app AR Trails      The cool and humid forest was exploding with life  and we found a broad diversity of lichens and mushrooms  The forest was mostly composed of mainly oriental beech trees  We were finding some mushrooms  but we all were aching to find more  Turns out the country had been experiencing some dry weeks before we got there                     The Haghartsin Monastery  nestled in the mushroom rich hills of Dilijan      From Dilijan we traveled south  stopping at some cultural and natural landmarks including the Haghartsin Monastery complex which was built between the 10th and 13th centuries  According to tradition  Armenia was the first nation to adopt Christianity in 301 A D   so most of the cultural landmarks throughout the country are chapels and monasteries  We also stopped at Lake Sevan  a large and beautiful lake in central Armenia that is surrounded by mountains  and Sevanavank  a monastery on the coast of the lake                     Patty on a local peak near the small town of Margahovit      We traveled south following Vardenyats Mountain Pass  the original silk road that was used from 2nd millennium BC to 16th century A D   stopping at an ancient structure that once housed traders on their journey  We drove through Vayots Dzor province to Hermon village  a small city found on the foot of the Yeghegis River  This trail was noted by Marco Polo in his journals travelling through this region and meeting Armenian folk  You can read more about the trail and its deep historical roots in the link  15                      Soviet era Jeeps essential for travel in Artavan      After waking up in our hotel  we attempted to dry the fungi using our dehydrators  It was unfortunate that we didn t consider the amperage difference  and thus fried one of the dehydrators  We then had our first official ICAM meeting in person  something that felt so surreal and joyous to us especially given the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic We discussed future goals and directions  breathing life and vigor to our mission  Satisfied with our objectives  and with a tasty Armenian breakfast  we hit the road again  Our eventual destination was Artavan  an incredible town in the mountains of the Vayots Dzor province  In Artavan we traveled deep into the mountains to sample mushrooms and soil in forests primarily composed of oak and juniper trees  Thankfully we had talented locals skillfully driving us through the rough terrain in old Russian military vehicles  When we returned to camp for the night  we were treated to the hospitality that Armenians are known for  We celebrated our newfound friendships around a bonfire and said cheers  or in Armenian  genatz  to our friendly hosts After a long day sampling in Artavan  we were ready for a day off  Luckily for us  Day 4 of our journey happened to be the Armenian holiday  Vardavar                     Water fights are an all day affair on Vartavar  From Left  Arik Joukhajian  Dr Arsen Gasparyan  Razmik Papikyan  Hasmik Djoulakian    Claudia Victoroff Bashian  Dr Patricia Kaishian  Razmik Sargsyan  Front  Tania Kurbessoian and Sona Galstyan      Originally a pre Christian celebration  Vardavar celebrates the goddess Astghik  goddess of beauty  love  and water  Armenians celebrate by splashing each other mercilessly with water throughout the day  We bought water guns and had a full fledged water fight Another highlight of our day off was visiting Areni 1 cave and having a wine tasting at the Areni winery  The Areni 1 cave is a large  partially excavated cavern where the oldest human shoe  5 500 years old    16  and the earliest known winery was discovered  In the evening we traveled back to Yerevan  where the Vardavar celebrations had taken over the city  We had to actively dodge buckets of water and children with water guns to get back into our hotels We spent the next two days in Yerevan  connecting with biologists at the Botany Institute of Armenia  which is located at the Yerevan Botanical Garden  and with Yerevan State University  Importantly  the collections from our trips are housed in the Yerevan Botanical Garden  contributing to the beginnings of a fungal herbarium there  We hope the housing of our collections in Yerevan will give Armenian biologists the opportunity to use them for years to come After recuperating from our extensive traveling and fieldwork in Yerevan  it was time to get back on the road  We traveled north to the province of Lori where we had lunch in the town of Vanadzor  which is the third largest city in Armenia and was largely built during the Soviet era  We traveled from Vanadzor to Margahovit where again we were lucky to have local drivers take us up 8 500 feet up a mountain so we could sample fungi and soil from Rhododendrons in the alpine region  Driving up switchbacks on the edge of the very foggy mountain had many of us nervous  but our drivers seemed extremely confident as they maneuvered around rocks  streams  and cows  After getting down off the mountain  we had dinner at a local brewery and tasted some beers brewed in the Lori province On our final day in the field  we visited the Stepanavan Dendropark  which is a gorgeous collection of trees from around the world  brought to Armenia in the 1930s by the Polish engineer forester Edmund Leonowicz  17  Half of the arboretum contains trees brought to the park  while the other half is a natural forest and one of Armenia s only remaining native pine forests  A diverse assortment of mushrooms awaited us along the trails of the park We returned to Yerevan and spent one last day together in Armenia  ending in a lovely dinner at the Yerevan Tavern                     The entrance to the new Yerevan Botanical Garden                          A greenhouse at the Yerevan Botanical Garden                           A group photo with our friends and collaborators at Tavern Yerevan       We all felt extremely grateful for one another  though the dinner was melancholy knowing we were about to part ways  Armenia is home to a beautiful and unique landscape and inspired Armenian scientists are working to understand and conserve that landscape every day  This trip was meant to serve as the beginning of sustained collaboration between Armenian scientists from the diaspora and those living in Armenia  Now having returned to the U S  we think we accomplished that and more  We look forward to a career s worth of collaboration and a lifetime of friendship with the Armenian mycological community                     Karmir Lake in Artavan  appearing to emulate the continents of the world      You can follow our organization  ICAM  on twitter   IC ArmenianMycoTo see our
