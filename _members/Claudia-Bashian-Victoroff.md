Claudia Bashian-Victoroff is currently located in Cleveland, Ohio while pursuing a dual-funded PhD in Biology from Case Western Reserve University and Holden Forest and Gardens. She is advised by David Burke. Her dissertation work is on ectomycorrhizal fungi in forest ecosystems with a focus on the diverse life strategies of different fungal taxa. Claudia’s research pairs field collections with molecular species identification to peak into the ‘black-box’ of mycorrhizal functions (Horton 2002). 

Before joining Case and Holden, Claudia received her MS in Environmental and Forest Biology in 2020 from the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry as a student in Tom Horton’s lab. She received her BS in Environmental Science in 2017 from Loyola University Chicago. Claudia’s MS research investigated fruiting responses of ectomycorrhizal fungi to nitrogen and phosphorus additions in Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. 
Claudia has presented her work at local, national, and international meetings including the Hubbard Brook Collaborator meeting, the Mycological Society of America annual meeting, and the International Mycological Congress. She is a student member of the Ecological Society of America, and the Mycological Society of America. Claudia is a founding member of the International Congress of Armenian Mycologists.
