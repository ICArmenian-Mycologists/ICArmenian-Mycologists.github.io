I am a Microbiologist and Mycologist, fascinated with all things micro and fungi.
I earned my Ph.D. in Microbiology from UC Riverside (2022), M.S. in Biology from California State University, Northridge(2016) and Bachelors in Microbiology B.S from California State University, Northridge (2013). My main goal is to integrate microbiology, mycology and bioinformatics.
\n

My Ph.D. research focused on studying Micro-Colonial Fungi (MCFs) isolated from Biological Soil Crusts (BSCs), the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and toxic tar pits. I have been conducting laboratory research in the areas of single nucleotide polymorphisms, genome sequencing and metagenomics. This involves data collection, DNA isolation, analysis and interpretation of results, including next generation sequencing data and bioinformatics analysis.

What I like to do when Iâ€™m not science-ing.. Anything crafty especially foraying for mushrooms and using those mushrooms to find natural dyes. I love taking craft materials and creating something beautiful.
