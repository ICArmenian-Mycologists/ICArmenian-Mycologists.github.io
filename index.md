# ICArmenian-Mycologists (ICAM)

[**International Congress of Armenian Mycologists**](https://icarmenian-mycologists.github.io/) is a collaborative effort between Armenian mycologists: Tania Kurbessoian Ph.D., Claudia Bashian-Victoroff M.S., Patty Kaishian Ph.D., and Arik Joukhajian.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}
Our focuses range from saprotrophic fungal diversity, the use of ectomycorrhizal fungi for forest remediation, and Khachkar lichen diversity interests. Please reach out to us if you are interested in collaborating. <br>

We currently have three fungal projects involving our American and Armenian teams:

Project 1: Exploring fungal ecology and biodiversity throughout Armenia; an international collaboration between biologists of Armenian descent Armenia is a small country situated within the biodiversity hotspot of the southern Caucasus Mountains of Western Asia. Armenian ecoregions consist of Caucasus mixed forests and Eastern Anatolian mountain steppes, which the World Wildlife Fund has determined to be “critical and endangered” (World Wildlife Fund). This status indicates that the region’s biodiversity urgently needs both intensive research and protection. This includes fungi, which are severely understudied compared to plants and animals. Millions of species of fungi remain undescribed around the world, and even more questions remain about the intricacies of fungal ecology. Because fungi are understudied worldwide, and Armenia has been home to a low proportion of that research, we aim to describe new fungal species, translate key indigenous ecological descriptions, and accrue data for answering critical ecological and evolutionary questions. All researchers involved in this project are ethnically Armenian and descendents of genocide survivors. As a historically oppressed and colonized country, Armenia and the biodiversity contained within, will benefit tremendously from scientific investment.

Project 2: Oak Mycorrhizae: Analysis of fungal community composition on oak species in collections at the Holden Arboretum (Kirtland, Ohio) and the Yerevan Botanical Garden (Yerevan, Armenia) Funded through Holden's Arboretum fellowship.

Mycorrhizal fungi grow on and within a host plant’s roots, extending into the soil to absorb nutrients. Additionally, mycorrhizal fungi protect trees from root herbivory, improve disease resistance, and increase drought tolerance. The diversity of these fungi is fundamentally important to host plants, including oak species. This research explores mycorrhizal fungi growing on oaks acclimated in two temperate regions. Holden Arboretum and Yerevan Botanical Garden will collaborate to sample roots from oak species at both gardens to compare their mycorrhizae. We will investigate whether habitat differences select for mycorrhizal fungi at the species level, and if the composition of these fungi differs significantly when the same tree species is acclimated in different temperate climates. Our goal is to contribute to global oak conservation by providing data on tree-fungus interactions, as soil biotic composition may be important to the success of trees in collections outside their native range.

Project 3: Bioinformatics in Armenia: Technology becomes more complex while also reducing in cost, biologists have been able to access deeper understanding of their systems.

Our team consists of accomplished author, writer, scientist and thinker Dr. Patricia Ononiwu Kaishian, mycorrhizae-whisperer and rock-climbing extraordinaire Claudia Bashian-Victoroff M.Sc., Joshua Tree mycorrhizae and fire fungi expert Arik Joukhajian, and recent Microbiology graduate Dr. Tania Kurbessoian (who specializes in black yeast population genomics).

The International Congress of Armenian Mycologists welcomes people from diverse backgrounds regardless of race, ethinicity, religion, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, political affiliation, national origin, or disability. Our main goal is to uplift the indigenous Armenian peoples in the scientific community.  <br>

## Our Mission

International Congress of Armenian Mycologists Mission Statement


The International Congress of Armenian Mycologists (ICAM) is a network of research scientists of Armenian ethnicity. Our diverse research backgrounds on various aspects of fungal biology are allied in the mission of biological, ecological, and social welfare of all Armenian life forms. As an organization we strive to conduct critical scientific research on the understudied fungal kingdom in the both ancient yet contemporary civilization of Armenia.   

Armenia is a predominantly indigenous nation in West Asia whose vibrancy and beauty has withstood the terrors of colonization and genocide for hundreds of years. As Armenians are locked in a struggle of liberation and self-determination against such forces, we believe that human liberation is intimately linked to the liberation of all life, not least of which is fungal.  Drawing from Armenia’s strong tradition of land stewardship and intimacy with nonhuman life forms, the goal of ICAM is to leverage our passions and training as scientists to simultaneously advance mycological science and Armenian sovereignty. 

We seek to build science capacity in Armenia by: collaborating with the nation’s already successful scientists through shared grants, co-authorship, and resource allocation; by providing financed scientific mentorship to Armenian youth; and by gathering biological data that can be used in the protection of land and life. Because fungi are understudied worldwide, and Armenia has been home to a low proportion of that research, we aim to describe new species and accrue data for answering critical ecological and evolutionary questions. Seating such research in Armenia will serve to bolster Armenia’s overall impact and contribution to science. 

Despite the common assertion to the contrary, science is informed by sociopolitical forces. ICAM recognizes and affirms the positive relationship between indigenous sovereignty and biological diversity in Armenia and beyond, and stands in solidarity with all indigenous social justice  efforts around the world.
